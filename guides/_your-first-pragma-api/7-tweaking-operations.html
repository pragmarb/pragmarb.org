<h2 class="display-5" id="tweaking-operations">Tweaking operations</h2>

<p>
  Now that we are aware of who the current user is, you'll probably have noticed the inefficiency of
  having to specify the author ID manually when creating a new article. Instead, we could just take
  the current user's ID and use that.
</p>

<p>
  In order to do that, we'll dive into the only piece of our resource that we haven't explored yet:
  operations. Operations contain the business logic of our API, and are the glue keeping policies,
  contracts and decorators together. In fact, all of the other components are used by operations.
</p>

<p>
  What we want to do here is set the <code>author</code> property of new articles to the current
  user automatically, so we are going to edit the <code>Create</code>. Here's what it should look
  like now:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Operation
        class Create < Pragma::Operation::Create
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  Not terribly exciting, right? The class is empty because all the complexity is nicely tucked into
  <code>Pragma::Operation::Create</code>, the default Pragma operation.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Nothing prevents you from building your own operations, but Pragma already
  ships with a set of five default operations: they are, predictably, <code>Index</code>,
  <code>Show</code>, <code>Create</code>, <code>Update</code> and <code>Destroy</code>. These default
  operations are incredibly powerful and customizable, so it is a very rare occurrence that you have
  to build your own operation from scratch. Instead, you'll usually inherit from the default ones
  and either tweak one of the other components or customize the operation itself.
</div>

<p>
  Here's a bit more info on the structure of operations: each operation has a <em>success track</em>
  and a <em>failure track</em>, and each of these tracks has multiple steps. By default, the
  operation's execution starts on the success tracks. The steps are run in order and their return
  value is checked. If a step returns <code>false</code>, the operation switches to the
  <em>failure</em> track and continues the execution there. Otherwise, the execution continues on
  the success track. (This might sound very confusing right now, but it's actually quite simple.
  More details will be provided at the end of this chapter.)
</p>

<p>
  In our particular case, we are first going to remove the <code>author</code> property and setter
  from the contract. Then, we are going to append a step to the success track of our operation. This
  can be done with the <code>step</code> DSL method:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Operation
        class Create < Pragma::Operation::Create
          step :set_author!

          def set_author!(options:, **)
            options['model'].update!(author: options['current_user'])
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> In case you're wondering, the method for adding a step to the failure track
  is named, quite fittingly, <code>failure</code>. It has almost the same exact API as
  <code>step</code>.
</div>

<p>
  What this will do is execute the entire default <code>Create</code> operation and, when it's done,
  update the record we just created, setting the <code>author</code> property to the current user.
</p>

<p>
  You can now try creating a new article without specifying the author, making sure to provide
  the appropriate authentication header:
</p>

<p>
  <pre><code>curl 'https://our-api.example.com/api/v1/articles' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Author-Id: bad87963-d8b2-408a-876e-c84740121aed' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Hello, world!",
    "body": "This is my first article. How cool is this?"
  }'</code></pre>
</p>

<p>You will notice that the new article got the <code>author</code> property set automatically.</p>

<p>
  However, the customization options don't just end here. In fact, the way we have implemented our
  new step is pretty inefficient, because it will first save the article without the author
  property, and then update the new article to set the author. This would fail, for instance, if we
  had a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint on the <code>author_id</code> column. How can we solve
  this, then? We should find a way to set the author <em>before</em> the record is persisted to the
  database.
</p>

<p>
  As it turns out, the <code>step</code> method is quite flexible, as it allows us to also specify
  the <em>position</em> of our new step. In this case, we want to set the author right before saving
  the record, which we can do by refactoring the <code>Create</code> operation like this:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Operation
        class Create < Pragma::Operation::Create
          step :set_author!, before: 'persist.save'

          def set_author!(options:, **)
            options['model'].author = options['current_user']
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  The end result is exactly the same, except for the fact that now only one <code>INSERT</code> SQL
  query will be executed, instead of an <code>INSERT</code> followed by an <code>UPDATE</code>.
</p>

<p>
  There is much more to operations: putting steps <em>before</em> other steps, replacing existing
  steps, destructuring options, creating, using and configuring macros, visualizing the steps... The
  possibilities are almost endless, and the API pretty simple. Since Pragma operations are based on
  <a href="http://trailblazer.to/gems/operation/2.0/">Trailblazer</a>, you should look at their
  documentation first, which will give you a very solid understanding of how operations work. Then,
  you can explore the
  <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma/tree/master/lib/pragma/operation">source code</a> of
  Pragma's default operations to understand what steps they execute and how you can tweak them.
