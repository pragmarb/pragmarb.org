<p>
  Now, let's try to restrict access to articles. If you remember, our <code>Article</code>
  model has an <code>author</code> relationship. We want to put the following restrictions
  in place:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    authors should be able to completely manage all of their articles, even when
    unpublished;
  </li>
  <li>regular users should only be able to read published articles.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Implementing an authentication system is outside of the scope of this guide, so for now just
  add this to your <code>application_controller.rb</code>:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # ...

  protected

  def current_user
    Author.find(request.headers['X-Author-Id'])
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>(Don't do this at home, please.)</p>

<p>
  Now, if you open the <code>Policy</code> class for your <code>Article</code> resource, you
  should see this empty policy:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      class Policy < Pragma::Policy::Base
        class Scope < Pragma::Policy::Base::Scope
          def resolve
            scope.all
          end
        end

        def show?
          true
        end

        def create?
          true
        end

        def update?
          true
        end

        def destroy?
          true
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

As you can see, currently everyone can do everything, which is not good. Let's tweak the policy a
bit to keep hackers away:

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      class Policy < Pragma::Policy::Base
        class Scope < Pragma::Policy::Base::Scope
          def resolve
            scope.where(author: user).or(scope.where(published: true))
          end
        end

        def show?
          record.published? || record.author == user
        end

        def create?
          record.author == user
        end

        def update?
          record.author == user
        end

        def destroy?
          record.author == user
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  This is pretty simple: basically, the first thing we do is define a "scope", which is a class
  whose purpose is to take a query and a user and refine the query so that it only includes records
  accessible by that user. In the rest of the policy we define the conditions that the record and
  user must meet in order for each action to be permitted.
</p>

<p>
  These are the basics of policies. There's nothing terribly fancy about them, but you are
  encouraged to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-policy">the GitHub
  repo</a> and play around with the code.
