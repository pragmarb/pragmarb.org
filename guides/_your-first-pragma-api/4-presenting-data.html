<h2 class="display-5" id="presenting-data">Presenting data</h2>

<p>
  Let's start with the basics: reading existing articles. First of all, we'll create a new
  author and article from the console:
</p>

<pre><code>$ rails c</code></pre>

<p>When the console is open, type the following into it:</p>

<p>{%highlight ruby%}author = Author.create!(
  first_name: 'John',
  last_name: 'Doe'
)

Article.create!(
  author: author,
  title: 'Hello, world!',
  body: 'This is my first article. How cool is this?'
){%endhighlight%}</p>


<p>Now, let's try to access our articles:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1/articles/'</code></pre>

<p>Here's what we get:</p>

<p>{%highlight json%}{
  "data": [],
  "total_entries": 0,
  "per_page": 30,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "previous_page": null,
  "current_page": 1,
  "next_page": null,
  "type": "list"
}{%endhighlight%}</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You might have noticed that, while Rails' default is to use incremental
  IDs, the starter template provided by Pragma uses UUIDs instead. UUIDs are preferable because
  they provide additional security, make sharding easier when the time comes for scaling your DB and
  also because clients can set them themselves, potentially reducing the number of round trips
  needed to complete an operation.
</div>

<p>
  What's going on here? Well, the instance decorator for your <code>Article</code> resource is
  empty, so Pragma is responding with an empty JSON object. Decorators take your resource instances
  and represent them as JSON. Each resource usually has two decorators: one for presenting the
  collection of resources and one for presenting a single instance, named respectively
  <code>Collection</code> and <code>Instance</code>.
</p>

<p>Let's edit the instance decorator, so that we can present articles properly:</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Decorator
        class Instance < Pragma::Decorator::Base
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Association
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Timestamp
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Type

          property :id
          property :title
          property :body
          property :published
          property :author_id, as: :author

          timestamp :created_at
          timestamp :updated_at
        end
      end
    end
  end
end {% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  As you can see, you can present a property as-is with <code>property</code>. We have also renamed
  our <code>author_id</code> property to <code>author</code>, so that it can be easily expanded in
  the future (more on this in the following guides).
</p>

<p>
  <code>timestamp</code>, on the other hand, is a helper that takes a datetime object and
  converts it into a UNIX timestamp, which is the preferred method to present times in an API.
</p>

<p>If you try to access the articles again, it will look much better now:</p>

<p>{% highlight json %} {
  "data": [{
    "type": "article",
    "id": "be9da202-fc8d-44e6-a8f7-54b1398cfad0",
    "title": "Hello, world!",
    "body": "This is my first article. How cool is this?",
    "published": false,
    "author": "bad87963-d8b2-408a-876e-c84740121aed",
    "created_at": 1509238434,
    "updated_at": 1509238434
  }],
  "total_entries": 1,
  "per_page": 30,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "previous_page": null,
  "current_page": 1,
  "next_page": null,
  "type": "list"
}{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  All the meta-data about the collection (the number of entries, the pagination information and
  so on) is provided by Pragma's default <code>Collection</code> decorator, which looks like this by
  default:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Decorator
        class Collection < Pragma::Decorator::Base
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Type
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Collection
          feature Pragma::Decorator::Pagination

          decorate_with Instance
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  You will almost never have to edit this, unless you want to add additional metadata about the
  collection.
</p>

<p>
  Decorators are built on top of
  <a href="https://github.com/trailblazer/representable">Representable</a>. They provide conditional
  properties, association expansion, type casting and many other powerful features. For a
  comprehensive list, have a look at
  <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-decorator">Decorator's documentation</a>.
