<p>
  Pragma is split into four components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-operation">Operation</a></strong>:
    operations encapsulate the business logic of your API. Pragma delegates to operations when
    an endpoint of your API is called.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-contract">Contract</a></strong>:
    contracts are like form objects, but for APIs. They also validate incoming GET parameters
    to ensure that the requests are well-formed.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-decorator">Decorator</a></strong>:
    decorators (sometimes also referred to as "representers") take your resources and present
    them to your API's clients in JSON or other formats.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-policy">Policy</a></strong>: policies
    are lightweight Ruby classes that determine which resources a user has access to and what
    operations they can perform on it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also provide additional tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-rails">Pragma::Rails</a></strong>
    is our Rails integration. It's a very thin layer taking care of dispatching to operations
    with the right parameters.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-rails-starter">Pragma Rails starter</a></strong>
    is our starter Rails template. It comes with Pragma (obviously!) plus some additional
    tools that will make API development a breeze.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In this guide, we'll leverage all of the aforementioned gems and tools to build a simple
  RESTful API for a blog engine with Pragma and Rails. Our API will allow users to list,
  display, create, update and delete articles. We will also implement a dead-simple
  authentication system to showcase Pragma's authorization system.
