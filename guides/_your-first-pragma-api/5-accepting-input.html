<p>
  Let's start with the basics: creating a new article. What we want to do is get the following
  cURL request to work properly:
</p>

<p>
  <pre><code>curl 'https://our-api.example.com/api/v1/articles' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Hello, world!",
    "body": "This is my first article. How cool is this?",
    "author": "bad87963-d8b2-408a-876e-c84740121aed"
  }'</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  In order to do that, we will edit our resource's <em>contract</em>. A contract is a class
  whose purpose is to validate the input to the resource's API endpoints and persist it to the
  underlying model.
</p>

<p>
  For our purpose, we will open the <code>API::V1::Article::Contract::Base</code> class and
  edit it like this:
</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}module API
  module V1
    module Article
      module Contract
        class Base < Pragma::Contract::Base
          property :title, type: coercible(:string)
          property :body, type: coercible(:string)
          property :published, type: form(:bool)
          property :author

          validation do
            required(:title).filled
            required(:body).filled(min_length?: 100)
            required(:author).filled
          end

          def author=(val)
            super ::Author.find_by(id: val)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>
  You might not believe it, but that's the only thing you need to do to get that cURL request to
  pass. Try it if you don't believe me!
</p>

<p>
  Let's dissect what that code means though. There are three parts to our contract:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The contract's <em>properties</em> or attributes, which in turn determine which aspects of
    the resource can be manipulated through the API. You can see that we are also coercing
    both our properties to strings, so that we can safely operate on them.
  </li>

  <li>
    The contract's <em>validations</em>. In our case, we want title, body and author to be filled,
    and the body to be at least 100 characters in length. If any of these validations fail, the
    article will not be persisted and the API will respond with the <code>422 Unprocessable
    Entity</code> status code and a list of huamn-readable validation errors, organized by property.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <code>author=</code> method. This is a custom setter/coercion method that will be used to
    convert the author's UUID into the relevant <code>Author</code> object. This serves two
    purposes: first, it allows us to use <code>author</code> both when presenting output and when
    accepting input, and second, it lets us easily validate that a valid author ID has been passed.
    In case you're wondering, we use <code>find_by</code> instead of <code>find</code> because we
    want to fail gracefully in case the ID is not valid.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Contracts are built on top of <a href="http://trailblazer.to/gems/reform/">Reform</a>, so whatever
  you can do with Reform, you can do with contracts. Coercion is provided by
  <a href="http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-types/">Dry::Types</a>, while validation is provided by
  <a href="http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-types/">Dry::Validation</a>. We urge you to read the
  documentation of all these gems and of
  <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-contract">Pragma::Contract</a> to learn how to make
  the most of them.
