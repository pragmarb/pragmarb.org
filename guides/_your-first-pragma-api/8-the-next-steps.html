  Now that you understand the basics of contracts, decorators, policies and operations, you are
  ready to start building APIs with Pragma. Here's what you can do to expand your knowledge:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Dive into the documentation and soure code of <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-contract">Contract</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-decprator">Decorator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-policy">Policy</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb/pragma-operation">Operation</a>. Make sure that you
    understand the fundamentals of how these components work together. Pragma is a huge shift from
    the Rails Way and can be difficult to grasp at first, but once you understand the basics your
    productivity will skyrocket.

</ul>
